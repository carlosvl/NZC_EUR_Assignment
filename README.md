# This is a small POC to show how to allocate a Energy Use Record that SPans out of a Calendar/Fiscal Year. 
it will look for the start date of the EUR, and only fire if there is no CFP assigned to it
then the logic will find the Assets, look for a CFP that has a start date/end date that fits the start date of the EUR and assign thet CFO to the EUR
